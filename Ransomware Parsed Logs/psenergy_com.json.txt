The entire list of downloaded data is kept confidential so as not to violate the privacy of the company and the data we downloaded. We do not know exactly who we are negotiating with and will not disclose such information.

time to pay
We know exactly what kind of company you are, we have studied you. In addition, we have a lot of your data. You are a multimillion-dollar company that can afford that amount. The only question is whether you are willing to pay damages and losses after your data is published. If you continue to negotiate like this, we will go nowhere and we will be forced to go public.
And we are not sure of your interest in making a deal.Therefore, we will not give you a discount at this stage.
Then change the negotiator or invite a more interested person in resolving the issue.Who will not waste time.It is extremely stupid to ask for a discount on nothing, not offering anything in return.Right?
You want a discount, we can give you a discount of 1%. It's a good discount. And the amount will be less than $ 2000000, pay. You have achieved what you wanted. The next step is up to you. Waiting for payment \
when will you pay?
