Hi
The price of the decryptor and deletion of your data is $100,000 in bitcoins. 140gb of data was stolen. At the moment we haven't published your name to the blog to keep the attack secret, but if you don't pay we will fix it! We know who you are and how much you earn.
Soon we will send you a tree of stolen data
not enought
Congratulations! But that doesn't change the situation.
The amount you offer is ridiculous and even offensive. Do you think your data is worth $500?
No
No!
100k!
Solve this issue within the company!
