In my pursuit of knowledge in the field of Cyber Threat Intelligence, I stumbled upon an intriguing concept presented by Will Thomas (BushidoToken) in his blog post titled "Unmasking Ransomware Using Stylometric Analysis: Shadow, 8BASE, Rancoz." This concept revolves around utilizing stylometry to identify potential modifications in new ransomware variants based on existing popular strains. If you're interested, you can read the blog post here. (Notably, Will Thomas also appeared on Dark Net Diaries, discussing his tracking of the Revil ransomware.) I recalled encountering a new project related to ransomware negotiation logs. Ransomware negotiation is typically an obscure area where visibility is limited. Val√©ry Marchive, co-founder of LeMagIT, recently shared a substantial collection of these logs, which can be found on GitHub here.
