Support: Hi. Could you introduce yourself?
Support: Your network was ATTACKED, your computers and servers were LOCKED.
Take into consideration that we have also downloaded data from your network that in case of not making payment will be published on our news website. After the payment you will get decryptor to all your systems, full file tree of downloaded data, non-recoverable deletion with proof log and security report on how you were hacked.
We downloaded all employees private info, company's financial documents and etc. In case of not making payment will be also published.
More than terabyte of private information has been downloaded from your servers. Including financial data of your company, personal data of your employees and their family members, company agreements, and most importantly.
Support: Overall price is $900,000. For this price you will get everything mentioned above. Please pass this information on to your management. In the future, we are ready to communicate only with the representative who can make such decisions. We are ready to provide you with a small set of files from different servers of your company.
Support: We are here.
Support: Are you ready to transfer money?
Support: According to the public records your revenue is [more than 30],000,000$, so this price is reasonable.

Also you should remember that the price is much cheaper then you will pay lawsuits, that your clients will send you and government fines, because you have lost so much of their data.
Support: What is your best proposal?
Support: We could not accept that offer, but we could reduce the price and give you the new one 800,000$. 
We could decrypt 1-2 files as samples.
Support: Yes. But today is weekend and we will decrypt them tomorrow.
Support: Yes. We are here and provide samples very shortly.
Support: The price is more then realistic for company with so revenue. What is your best proposal?

Support: The static shows opposite. A lot of sources say that people start to buy cars more, because of pandemic. Anyway what is your best proposal?
Support: Yes. We could forward you several samples.
Support: We wrote you previously. 
We will give you decrypt tool for all your machines, security report on how you were hacked, file tree on what we have downloaded from your network and wiping log of that information.
Support: Here is several samples:

Support: NO. We took much more, around 1 terabyte. We wrote that previously too, including the data of clients and employees.
Support: It is more then enough. You should understand that downloading data is very easy process when you have an access to the whole system.
Support: It is impossible to make so big list. We will try to make a list of servers and desktops.

Support: That is not enough. We could reduce the price and give you a new offer 700,000$. You should remember that the price is much cheaper then you will pay lawsuits, that your clients will send you and government fines, because you have lost so much of their data(Ids, ssn, credit cards).
Support: We don't think, that our estimates are incorrect. Your financial reports are somewhat more reliable, than your word here and now. And your proposal here is just from the textbooks - ten times less, than our initial demand. It seems, that you do not understand, how works our group. We don't ask $20 millions, to receive our demand of $750,000.So you should understand, that our team have plenty of projects running, and yours - just one from many. If we don't reach an agreement, we'll just shorten our profit.
Support: Also, your notifications will not save private data of your employees and customers, it will be used long time in many bad purposes. Think about your reputation, which will be damaged in so hard times for business.
Support: Of course, we understand, that your work here is not easy and requires efforts to convince your board members. But we are still far from agreement. Our estimates are still much higher, than your proposal. We hope, that you will give us better price. And since it is our mutual interest to speed up our negotiations as much, as we can - take more serious steps toward us. It would be much easier than for us to make steps to you in response.
Support: That is not enough. There is many ways how you could get additional funds. You could apply on the loan in the bank or take out your savings or cut expenses or sell something and etc. You are just wasting time now.
Support: OK. We could reduce the price and offer the new amount 500,000$. The price is more then reasonable for that data and your reputation.
Support: We told you above that there is several ways to find additional funds.
Support: Keep updating us please.
Support: We need some time to discuss this offer.
Support: We could the offer today but it should be more profitable. We could give you some more discount and offer new price 400,000$.
Support: We looked throw your finance records, bank accounts and know that you have more available funds. We are ready to give you some discount, but that price is not reasonable. We own a lot of private data which cost much more.
Support: You have more funds on your accounts.
Support: We are ready to accept 200,000$.
Support: Are you ready to pay?
Support: We accept only bitcoins.
Support: There is several ways how you could exchange funds. You should check google and choose the most convenient for you.
Support: OK. Keep updating us please.
Support: We reduce price as much as we can. We totally sure that you had sales during this time, so you have sources from where you could add funds.
Support: We went as low as we could. The price is little more then 20% from starting amount. It is very huge discount, especially if we remind that we own a lot of valued documents, credit cards and etc. We could not cut our profit anymore.
Support: I made a request to my managers about additional discount anyway.
Support: We understand that and that's why we gave you so huge discount. We do not have purpose to ruin your business.
Support: We are ready to reduce a little more a price. The new offer is $185,00.
Support: We will return all your data and provide security report.
Support: We will give you all files and delete them from the cloud. It is not a problem. We never treat clients who paid us, we play only fear games.
Support: OK. Keep updating us please
Support: OK. So we could split the payback. You pay us what you have now and we provide you the decrypt tool. After you pay the rest, we provide your data back.
Support: It is not enough compare to your revenue and data which we got from you. So you could use this option and pay in two steps. You could start to work properly even today and find the rest very fast.
Support: We could not wait also. Why could you just split the payback and start  to work today?
Support: We understand that and this is a reason why we gave so huge discount and offer you to split the payment. It is good option for you. The company will start to work today and you could earn the little rest very fast.
Support: OK. We could accept that price. Here is the wallet:
[redacted]
Support: That is correct. As soon as we receive payment we provide required info.
Support: How is it going so far?
Support: When do you expect to proceed with the payment?
Support: You should confirm the wallet before transfer.
Support: OK. Keep updating us please.
Support: Here is the new wallet:
[redacted]
Support: That is correct.
Support: Did you make a transfer?
Support: We received payment and provide required info shortly.
Support: 1. The decryption tool uploaded to the cloud. You should launch it with administrator rights and wait until it finishes decryption process.
