Hello
To decrypt your files and prevent us of destructive actions against your company you will need to pay $120 000 . We also have all your files.
yes
We take into account your profits and the amount of work needed to encrypt your information, that's how the sum is calculated.
What would you like to offer me?
Well, this isn't true. Even by public official data about your revenue it's obvious that you are capable of paying 120,000$. You may make your own offer about the price but it shouldn't differ from mine by a large sum.
We will sell your files.
Why are you telling me this information about another backup copy?
You didn't even ask for proof about the files we have acquired. The information about an attack on your company will spread like wildfire on the Internet when we publish it. You will most likely pay a fine bigger than the sum we are asking for.
Ok. It will take some time. I will send you a list of files soon
Good. I will send you screenshots of several files.
