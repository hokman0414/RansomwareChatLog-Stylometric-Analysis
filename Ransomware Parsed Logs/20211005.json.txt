Hello and welcome to Hive.
How may I help you?
We have 1.8 TB of exfiltrated files.
Stop talking shit otherwise I'll disclose them
To decrypt your files and prevent them to be disclosed you will need to pay $1,200,000.
The price is not a subject to discuss.
The price isn't negotiable. I'll wait, there is no hurry
reconnect for what?
yes
Okay
