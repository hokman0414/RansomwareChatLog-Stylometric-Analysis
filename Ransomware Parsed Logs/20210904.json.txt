Hello, are you ready to negotiate?
Please introduce yourself. You title and company name.
Yes, we did. I will upload the 30% of the files we currently hold as a list. You will be able to choose any 2 random files of your choice from the list and we will upload them as a proof.
As you already know - your network and all of your data were encrypted by CONTI team. Besides the encryption process we've downloaded a large pack of your internal documents and files that will be published in case our negotiations fail. How it happens can be seen on our website https://continews.icu
The recovery price is $980000 (17 BTC). If you want to make sure we can recover all of your data - you can send us the two files of your choice and we will decrypt them free of charge.
If we reach mutual agreement your will be provided with decryption tool, none of your internal data will be published and you will be provided with security tips on how to avoid further breaches.
We strongly recommend to review our offer in a timely manner and contact your insurance provider to avoid additional expenses from your side on security software and on building the new network from scratch.
