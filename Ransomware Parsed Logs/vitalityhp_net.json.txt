data from your network
we will give you this information after you pay the ransom
we will soon send you a tree of stolen data
https://temp.sh/vpCYM/vit%20list.txt
130k files, 122gb
We'll send you the files in a moment
The price of decrypt and delete data 1.000.000$. we accept payment in BTC

We studied your revenue data. we found information that the revenue is about $100 million. in addition, your site translates to the site of a large california company with $1 billion in revenue. based on this, the requested amount is quite real. pay and no one will ever know about the attack. we will return all your files and tell you about the attack, and delete your data from our servers forever. if you delay and do not negotiate actively, we will publish a post about you on our blog.

One company refused to pay the ransom. and suffered a lot. there is a lot of information about us on the internet. here is an example
No, it's not enough!
we have your sensitive data, marketing data, financial data, passports, iti, transactions, and so on. so think about the damage that publishing data can do to you. think about the damage you will get.
if you are not ready to pay more than 100k, you can leave the chat room and wait for the publication of your data
for now, you have time to find money. but time will not last indefinitely. we need a deadline. if you drive unproductive talks, or don't come in for a chat, we will publish a post about your company on our blog. so far, we haven't done that
We know exactly who you are. don't start talking about limiting finances and so on. we know who you are and how much you can pay. so we will stand our ground and take tough measures in case of disobedience
Put aside unnecessary talk. negotiate constructively.
that doesn't make sense. why are you coming in here?
If you're not interested, leave the chat room and don't come in.
bye
