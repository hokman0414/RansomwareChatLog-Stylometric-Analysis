hi
to decrypt the data and avoid publication you need to pay us. we haven't published your name on our blog yet
$100k
we have a test decryptor, you can try. just use it correctly
then use another file
you'll have to look for money. not that small a company. we know who you are
I'll give you advice right away. we don't like whiners and negotiators. we are serious people and we have a reputation and we came here not to play and not to joke. so pay and be free
we accept payment only in BTC

use brokers. we will not accept 10k
you're funny
will you pay? or should I publish a post about you?
