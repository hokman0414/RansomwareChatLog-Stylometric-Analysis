Hello, you need pay.
Also we downloaded a lot of information from you.And so far we haven't published anything.There is no mention of an attack.
soon we will send you a tree of stolen data

So why do you start negotiations with lies. We know exactly what kind of company you are. How much money you make, how many employees you have, computers, and so on. The ransom price is always fair. $4,000,000
I want to warn you right away. If you don't actively negotiate, and you drag it out, your name will quickly end up on our blog
Okay. We'll wait.
We are guaranteed to decrypt all your files.You can also use the decryption test.Our reputation is impeccable!But your offer is not serious.We will not accept it
Okay. $3,800,000
ok
3700000$
3650000$
time to pay
What you suggested does not suit us. We gave you a discount
$3,600,000
You have taken the wrong position. As long as you negotiate in this way, we will not get to the right result. We're not going to give you a big discount.
well?
Good. We'll wait for the results of your meeting.
well?
Your price is still not satisfactory to us. We will give you an additional discount. Paying $3,575,000.
We are waiting for an answer tomorrow.
?
Unfortunately, that's not enough either. We have consulted and decided to give you an additional discount of $75,000
$3,500,000
Decryptor will delete at - 2023-04-20 10:43:18
As you can see in the chat window, your decryptor has been removed
I saved the decryptor before deleting
When will yoy pay? it's time to pay
If you do not respond, we will consider this to be ignoring and will have to move on to publication. You have no initiative in resolving the issue, you are not contacting us, do you want us to publish your data?
Apparently after the first attack you did not understand that it is necessary to monitor the security of systems. After payment, we will let you know how your network was penetrated, we will not attack you again and tell you what to do to prevent such cases again. The first group didn't give you any advice?
No, it means that the first attack did not make you understand that you need to monitor and ensure the safety of your company, employees and reputation. You have to pay for all that. Usually companies take care of this, pay good sysadmins, buy different programs and more, but in short ensure security. Or pay for pentest services with post-pay, which is what we do, and we know the price of their services and their work. Based on all this, the amount you offer is very small, and it is not enough to solve the problem. The price is $3,600,000.
Well? Time to pay, or else the first part of the data will be on the blog. You have been given plenty of time
