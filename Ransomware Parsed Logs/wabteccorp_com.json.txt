So? Weekend ended long time ago. Are you ready to pay?
You must hurry up. We're not going to wait you forever. We'll have to raise the price by friday if we won't receive full payment by tomorrow evening.
You already have spent 3 weeks. It's more than enough to check your balance and obtain cryptocurrency. The price will be raised to 30M from tomorrow.
