Hi, what's the news?
1,500,000$ USD
If you pay quickly, we'll give you a discount.
While we're negotiating we've paused the timer and hidden you from the blog
If you pay within 48 hours, we will give you a 30% discount
Ok
what news?
We do not sell data, without publication. And most importantly - our reputation.
it's time to pay
We are not talking about selling your data. we will put it on our blog for free for everyone if you do not pay. you are negotiating for a very long time, and this will not play into your hands. we know that you are specifically delaying negotiations so that we agree to a lower amount. on the contrary, if you pay quickly we can give you a discount for speed.
we are ready to give you a 30% discount on a quickly payment
I think you'll understand how much your data is worth after it's published. When you incur reputational losses, fines from the state, courts and others. You will lose even more money than we are asking for. For your company, with multimillion-dollar revenues, paying that amount and forgetting about it won't be a big deal. I'm sure your boss has much more money in his personal cryptocurrency account
when wiil you pay?
