Hi. Ok.
Here is the scheme. You pay us $5,000,000. We give you decryptor and remove your company from our blog and never publish stolen files as well delete them.
you had an oppotunity to secure your network at a better time then. misfortune never comes alone. price is $5M.
We are receiving payments from companies including public ones almost every day. Everything went good with all of them.
hi. ok. we send data listing after payment. these are the terms.
hi! we do not provide a list of data without payment
u must pay. or u will soon have the ability too see files on blog as countdown ends.
the best we can afford is to send you partial list of files.

You will get complete file tree after payment. As we have told before these are the terms of the deal. If you want to review the file tree for free - wait until your data is published.

We can confirm we have now revealed all of your data, your data will be destroyed right after you make a payment of $5,000,000 to our cryptowallet, we will never attack you anywhere in the future.
Are you going to pay? We've been waiting.
Though the amount you have offered is far away from our demanded amount, we can provide you a 25% discount as a goodwill gesture. 3750000$ for tool and data. BTC wallet for payment: bc1qh98g7cu0wnrf7awuqyjjs8uzc0sx7knp4d78kj.
It doesn't work this way. We will not accept 155,000. Your data will be posted if you do not pay within 24 hours.
There's a difference between us in how we estimate value of information and cost of our postpaid pentest service. The price is far bigger than your offered amount. However we offer a final discount if you pay us today. Final price is $3,3kk.
