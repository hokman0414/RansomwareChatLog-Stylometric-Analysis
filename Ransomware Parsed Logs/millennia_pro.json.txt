Also, if you have any thoughts of refusing to pay 2023-02-21 07:16:07, we will publish the data that was stolen from your online storage. If you choose to use the backups you have, we will simply publish your company's financial documents.

Yes the call was indeed made by us
We attack companies all over the world and speak virtually every language.
The payment is made in BTC cryptocurrency and you will never know about it. However, we can say that we are not political hackers, you just have weak security and we need money, that's all.

If the documents that we have get into the public domain, believe me, this amount will seem insignificant because of the losses that can result from leak
This is the price for your competitors, if someone wants to buy your company's internal documentation, we will sell it to them, but the sooner you pay the amount offered to you, the less likely it is that someone will use the information
If you want to keep your data from falling into the wrong hands or other organizations, you need to resolve the $300,000 ransom payment as soon as possible, and the data will be destroyed
And accordingly you get a decryptor for both versions of Lockbit 2.0 and 3.0 black
Do you have any new information? Have you started preparing to pay yet?
You have 17 days left, we advise you to prepare everything in advance
Hi, do you have any new information?
We are willing to drop the price for you. The final price is $200,000 this is our final offer!
