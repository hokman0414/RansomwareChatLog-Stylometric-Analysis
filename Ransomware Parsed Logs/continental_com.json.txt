Hello. We understand. Yes, the list contains all the data we have. You have never asked for file size information. The total size exceeds 40 TB.
Hello. Your silence lasts too long. You need to pay.
Hello. Your files will be deleted and nobody will know about the breach if a payment is made. Your files will appear on our leaks site if no payment is made.
Hello, ok.
Hello, no word from your side though it is a new business day already. You need to pay.
Hello. We've been waiting.
Should we regard your silence as a rejection of the negotiation process?
