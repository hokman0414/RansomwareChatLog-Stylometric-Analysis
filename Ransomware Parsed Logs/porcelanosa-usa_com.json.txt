Hi
The price of the decryptor and deletion of your data is $1,500,000 in bitcoins. 275gb of data was stolen. At the moment we haven't published your name to the blog to keep the attack secret, but if you don't pay we will fix it! We know who you are and how much you earn.
It doesn't concern us. Solve the problem within the company! Call the main office in Spain. Soon we will send you a tree of stolen data

Have you looked at the data tree? When will you pay?
