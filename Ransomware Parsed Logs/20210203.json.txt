Hello! Technical support is ready to answer you
Hello!
 That's right, to start a dialogue, I ask you to answer 2 questions 1) 
Are you a recovery company 2) Do you have insurance against ransomware 
programs?
Before
 we move on to discussing the price, upload 4-5 files of encrypted files
 no more than 10MB using any file exchanger, we will decrypt these files
 as a test
Ok, write to me as you are ready to provide files
Also
 send us the ecdh_pub_k.bin file from those computers from which you 
will download files, this ecdh_pub_k.bin will be placed in% appdata%
Ok
independent attempts without our help to decrypt files may lead to their loss, I would not advise you to do this
ok
I downloaded your files, please wait
link will be available for 1st download https://dropmefiles.com/[redacted]
Ok, now we can continue the dialogue
yes, 1 minets please
We
 know that [redacted] is a large company with an annual turnover of $ [more than two dozens] 
million a year, a price of $ 400,000 for a complete expansion of all 
systems
We can make a 
discount, but it must be reasonable, we will wait for comments from the 
company and we are waiting for you in this cha
Ok, we are in touch and ready for a dialogue, and ask them about insurance
We understand 
perfectly well that if you had backups, if you didn’t have a dialogue 
with us, we can accept. from you 100 000 usd, it will be a big discount,
 if you agree then we will move on to the deal, if you need time to 
think it over, this is your time in any case you need the decryptor, not
 me
We understand that the company can afford to pay 100 00, we went to you for the purchase and made a big discount
100 000
Ok, also if they have insurance, this will not incur financial losses for them at all, the insurance will pay everything
Well then, I advise you to buy it in the future.
We had clients from italy who could easily pay 350,000, let's stop at 85k, it will be optimal for you and us!
ok
They
 worked with the bank, we cannot tell you the company, for the reason: 
they paid, we keep secret information about our clients who made the 
transaction
Okay, do you need instructions on how to buy bitcoin? Or will you do everything yourself?
ok
There
 are bitcoin ATMs in italy, you can use it or buy bitcoins on the 
exchange https://www.finder.com/it/how-to-buy-bitcoins, or find a 
private bitcoin broker in italy (this is the safest option) as soon as 
you are ready to transfer I will give you a wallet
https://coinatmradar.com/country/105/bitcoin-atm-italy/
1) For ATM, you'd 
better top up your wallet and then send us 2) File size doesn't matter, 
we made all required tests before encrypt your network
3) post will be removed today
The decryptor works the same as the encryptor only in the other direction
During
 the day, the moderator of [redacted] will delete the topic, I wrote 
him a private message and also wrote in the topic, you can check it
ok

Well,
 as soon as you are ready to transfer money, write to us, you will give 
you a new link to the chat, where we will conduct the transaction, it 
will be better for your safety and anonymity
No, but I do 
not think that you will have any problems with the transfer, you should 
be able to transfer to any bitcoin wallet
You will need to somehow solve this problem, and be able to transfer to any bitcoin wallet
