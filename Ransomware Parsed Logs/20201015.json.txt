Hello
We have another messages from recovery company
All recovery company is scam and just write us for buy decrypt.
Hello yes we have progress but we dont
 understand which version our software you are encrypted, can you send 
me time when you encrypted?
So, your files encrypted tested 
version our software and we must scan all your system for find keys for 
decrypt, and also my boss up price for you so final amount is 30,000$
Scan with private global decryption 
key and when scanned collect all keys and decrypted it in real time, we 
can connect to teamviewer and scan it or send it you after payment
In any case need teamviewer.
Im already repeat you - your network 
encrypted with tested versions our software so for finding keys need 
scan your system, our scanner with private key and we do not provide it 
just like "download this and run". If you cant provide teamviewer and 
pay $30,000 - goodbye
