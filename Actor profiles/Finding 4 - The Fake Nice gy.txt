ok
Specify when you will?
Any news?
We can send you some random files so that
you can be sure that we have the files. We will not send the tree. But
just know that we have a lot of files and the leak is big, if you do not
understand the severity of the situation, go and read our blog.
Didn't you download the old archive? There is data.
Hello! You have been infected by the Avaddon ransomware. Price for you is $80,000. To receive a general decryptor, you need to pay the amount indicated to you in the BTC on the landing page. After paying the ransom, you will receive a general decryptor that will decrypt absolutely all PCs and servers on your network. We will also provide you with a list of vulnerabilities in your network so that a similar situation does not happen to you in the future. We also guarantee the anonymity of the and attack no one will recognize this incident. We are ready to talk to you and discuss on this matter.
We are here 24/7, for all your questions, write here and we will help you.
You must understand that the amount is indicated for everything together. We cannot provide you with a decryptor for only part of the files. The decryptor will decrypt all files.
We understand your situation and are ready to offer you a 15% discount on the total amount.
How much can you offer us, but please note that we cannot agree on $ 5,000.
$ 6,000 is still not enough. We cannot work with this amount. You need to offer more.
After payment we will give you our Avaddon Decryptor, which will decrypt all your files on all your PCs and servers in a few hours. You can get back to work very quickly.
We want to help you and have made a big discount, but we cannot accept such a small amount.
You need to offer more so that we can work.
you give us amounts that we are not interested in at all, if you want to get a decryptor you need to offer a much higher amount
we understand the current situation and are ready to make concessions to you and charge a new price of $ 60,000
what is the maximum amount you are willing to offer us?
Guys ?
Ok
You need to send 1.44 BTC to Bitcoin address: [redacted]
[redacted]
This address is correct.
Have you already figured out the problem? Because the address is correct, the problem is on your part.
If you yourself cannot buy, then seek help from a specialist. Because everything works from our side.
Guys, what nonsense are you starting to say, you just tried to put $ 55k into our account and work with us, and now you start telling us tales that this is a lot of money, a lot of money is millions of dollars, and you work with us for only 55k despite the fact that we gave you a huge discount !? Did you lie to us that you tried to send money? We are a serious organization we are "Avaddon Ransomware". If you have doubts about data decryption, then on your landing page there is a "Test Decryption" section, upload an image file weighing up to 2MB and after a while you will receive a decrypted file.
Guys, do you want us to give you the motivation to pay us?
:D
Take it. We've stolen over 25GB of data from your network. What if I tell you the exact number of files? These are 50382 files!
If payment is not made within 24 hours, we will publish a post about the leakage of your data, make mass spam by emails of your competitors, clients, partners and tell them that all confidential data that they had associated with you was leaked through your fault. Believe me, we know how much money will be spent on investigations and lawsuits. It will be much more than 55k.
Do you need confirmation that we have the data? This is not a problem, we will provide them to you. Just tell us to do it.
I hope you pay and I donâ€TMt have to tell you what else we will do with your network in case of non-payment...
Cooperating with us, we guarantee you complete confidentiality on our part, General decryptor with which you can restore absolutely all files on your PCs / Servers, a complete tree of the files we have taken from you and confirmation of their deletion after payment. We will also point out to you the vulnerabilities in your network and give recommendations on what to do to eliminate these vulnerabilities, following our security recommendations, you will be practically invisible to hacker attacks.
I think the choice is obvious. I changed the time for you to 24 hours, the time has gone. Tick tock tick tock
these are your words "Ok we are ready to pay 55k$ is it ok with you? "
In the Meaning, you didn't say that? Check out our communication history above, you wrote it.
We are not interested in this price.
11,000 $ are not enough.
You need to offer more if you do not want us to publish your files.
Guys, you do not understand, you have a lot of problems. To restore the normal mode of operation, you need a lot of time and money. If you do not pay, then you are waiting for news in our blog, we will publish a lot of your files that you will not like. You will get damage to much more than $ 55,000. We offer you a solution to all these issues for an adequate price.
We have already made a big discount for you and are ready to work with you, but we are not satisfied with $ 11,000.
We are ready to make a small discount for you.
Perhaps we can go down a little lower, but the price you offer absolutely does not suit us, we have already made you a big discount, if
You have been infected by the Avaddon
ransomware. To receive a general decryptor, you need to pay the amount
indicated to you in the BTC on the landing page. After paying the
ransom, you will receive a general decryptor that will decrypt
absolutely all PCs and servers on your network. We will also provide you
with a list of vulnerabilities in your network so that a similar
situation does not happen to you in the future.
Your price is 45,000 dollars. $ 2,500 is very small, we cannot agree to it.
We can offer you a 5% discount.
We cannot agree on 5k. Offer more, much more.
If you refuse to pay the amount specified on
the page, you can see all your files in our blog for leaks. I think you
do not want, and your company is important reputation.
We can offer you a 10% discount.
Your price is $40,000.
Price $ 10,000 still small
If you want to return your files and do not
want us to create a post about your company and have posted information
about you there, then you need to offer us more than $ 10,000.
We understand the current situation and want
to meet you halfway, but we cannot agree to such a low price. You need
to think carefully and offer us more than $ 10,000.
Why do you have to pay? Let the company pay the ransom.
We do not give lessons.
We are ready to make a very big discount for
you. $ 35,000 this is our last proposal, it cannot be less.
I understand you, but the price is for the
company. The company can afford to pay this amount. You yourself got
yourself in a dead end when you wanted to pay from your pocket. Here we
will not be able to help.
If your company does not want to pay the
amount, then they will have more problems than to dismiss you. And they
need to think about damage and reputation.
Talk to the boss and explain to him that he
needs to pay a ransom if he wants to save time and not lose even more
money for restoring the work order.
We will never agree in the amount of 10k or 15k!
You must collect more money. We already help you very much when it has reduced the price to 35k.
We can make a very big discount for you. You
need to pay $ 30,000. If you want to return your files, you need to pay
this amount. This is the last discount, the price cannot be lower.
We did everything you could, now your turn.
We are not interested in 12k, the last price is 30k!
How much maximum can you offer?
How can we help you? We have already done a big discount for you.
I understand, but I can not do anything.
We made a very big discount for you.
I do not know how and where you take money. You should do it.
Credit in a bank, lend from a friend, ask the boss. You should do it.
I repeat, we cannot agree in the amount of 13k or even 15k. It's too little!
Your price is 30k.
And we explained many times that we cannot agree to less.

Evidence that we have the files and we will publish them if you donâ€TMt find the money.
Sir, it seems to us that you do not quite
understand the seriousness of the situation by offering us such a small
price. Before the price of $ 45,000 for your network was set, we carried
out a detailed analysis of your company's income and financial
statements. We know about your financial capabilities so the price
offered we are not satisfied with you. We are ready to give you a
discount and offer $ 30,000 this is the lowest price. The files that we
showed you are just a drop in the ocean, in fact, we have about 10GB of
data pulled from your network and this data includes finance and
accounting, passports, credit card data, agreements and contracts, tax
data of your company for the last few years, confidential documents,
data on your clients and tens of thousands of other data. Imagine the
scale of the leak of this data and what consequences it will entail,
such as lawsuits and proceedings. Your reputation will be severely
collapsed. Also, if we make a post about you on the blog, then a DDOS
attack will fall on your site 24/7 and your site will simply be
inaccessible to your customers. Most importantly, this is not all that
awaits you in our arsenal there are many more tools and techniques with
which we will harm you more and more every day. We are a serious threat
to your company and we ask you to take us and our proposals seriously.
Consider our proposed price of $ 30,000 and let's cooperate.
Cooperating with us, we guarantee you
complete confidentiality on our part, General decryptor with which you
can restore absolutely all files on your PCs / Servers, a complete tree
of the files we have taken from you and confirmation of their deletion
after payment. We will also point out to you the vulnerabilities in your
network and give recommendations on what to do to eliminate these
vulnerabilities, following our security recommendations, you will be
practically invisible to hacker attacks.
Hey!
We already wrote earlier that this is not enough. Your price is 30K.
Look for money.
We can help you when you have 30K
