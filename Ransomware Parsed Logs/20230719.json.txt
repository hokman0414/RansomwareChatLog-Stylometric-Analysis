> These files were taken from your network prior to encryption. You can pick 2-3 random files from the list and we will upload them to this chat as a proof of possession. To prove that we can properly decrypt your data you can upload 2-3 encrypted files to our chat and we will upload decrypted copies back.

We're looking through your financial papers to come up with a reasonable demand to you. We offer: 1) full decryption assistance;
2) evidence of data removal;
3) security report on vulnerabilities we found;
4) guarantees not to publish or sell your data;
5) guarantees not to attack you in the future.

Let me know whether you're interested in a whole deal or in parts. This will affect the final price. 
If we don't get a respond within next 24 hours, we will be forced to announce your corporate data leak on our blog.
> Your data will be posted soon.
