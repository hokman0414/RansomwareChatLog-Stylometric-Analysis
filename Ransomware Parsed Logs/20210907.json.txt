Hello and welcome to BlackMatter. How may I help you?
To decrypt your files you have to purchase the decryption software. It costs $15m for you.
First of all, can you introduce yourself, state the company name and your position in it.
We have the doubts you are from company we need the proofs that you are from there.
So how can you prove it?
You cant prove it because you don't know it. This is just confirmed our doubts have a nice day.
This is ridiculous, you can prove it in hundreds different ways, without compromising so called “privacy”.
To start a cooperation, we have to know with whom we a dealing and you failing it. So far you looks as some boring guy who got a sample from virus total and obtained the chat link.
You can upload the company’s letterhead, you can tell to us domain controllers name, name of backing up software it is just a few)
So far it looks as your main objective is to f*ck with us)
Here we go again, to negotiate with whom with some random Joe?
Ok, this is simple prove you are from company or just go grab another sample from VT.
Oh [redacted] you so clever) virustotal.com
You have the options
1.	Internal windows domain name.
2.	Domain administrators name.
3.	Backup software name.
This information aren’t locked by encrypting software or police)
2) administrator 
this is too generic give us another one
Ok, John thank you. So you see the price, you need to pay it.
Your English is too sophisticated for me, can you try again)
You see the demanded price. If you’ll pay it you will get.
1.	The decrypting tools.
2.	Your data back (we took 1.5TB, PII, NDA, emails, MSSQL databases)
3.	A file tree.
4.	Explanation how the company was breached.
We have no idea what a price is adequate for you. We can make 10% discount for fast payment and remove 25% BTC transaction fee.  Make the offer. But to make it simple we will not consider the offer less than 7-figure number.
Do you want me upload a sample with office documents? The emails and sqls are too big but we have them all.)
One more detail we know the company doesn't have the backups. Rubrik is gone)
You have tapes for [redacted] but they are useless without software.
This is the screenshot for DA hashes and passwords.

Yo can get the sample by following link.

We will not make DB screenshots too much work.
We have dbs from
[redacted]SQL
SQL2014Test
[redacted]SQL1
[redacted]-SQL
[redacted]-SQL
Should or is? )
To complicated, we said what will provide if we’ll agree on price. $700k is unacceptable.
Without any conditions, you are paying for decrypting tools and fast recovery, the data is collateral. You will not recover so easily without decryptor. We can do negotiations pretty long; time is on our side. If you are want to finish this fast make the acceptable offer.
How you evaluate data’s price can I see a formula?
You can do incremental and we can do decremental steps, make the offer that we can turn down. 1 is to far away from 15.
We just checked the random db, data is fine and not encrypted. Have a look.

Nothing sn meaningless, we did a good pentest for your company it has to be rewarded. $1kk is not enough. Do some consultations and come with a better offer.
One of your competitors was hit the same yesterday if it helps to your feelings.
If you will offer the good price today we can make a decent discount for you.
By the way they offer much more then you.
You either, you tried to do it on Sunday but you know what has happened.
